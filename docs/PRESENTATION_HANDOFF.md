## PLATFORM OVERVIEW

**Waypoint** is a cloud-based DAEP (Disciplinary Alternative Education Program) management platform
built specifically for Texas school districts. It is developed and owned by **Clear Path Education
Group, LLC**.

Waypoint replaces paper-based, spreadsheet-driven, and email-threaded DAEP workflows with a unified
digital system that manages everything from the moment a discipline incident is reported through the
student's return to their home campus.

**One sentence:** Waypoint is the only end-to-end DAEP compliance and operations platform built
for Texas schools.

## THE PROBLEM (Use for Problem Slides)

Texas school districts operating DAEPs face a complex, high-stakes compliance and coordination burden
that paper and email systems cannot handle:

- **Incident documentation** must meet PEIMS and TEA reporting requirements — errors result in
  federal funding risk
- **SPED/504 compliance** requires manifestation determinations, ARD meetings, and strict timelines
  *before* placement — violations trigger OCR complaints
- **Multi-role approval chains** must be completed and documented by 6 different staff roles before
  a student can be placed — missed steps create liability
- **Student orientations** must be scheduled, completed, and documented before the day count starts
  — undocumented orientations invalidate placements
- **Daily attendance and behavior** at the DAEP campus must be tracked separately from the home
  campus — two systems, twice the error risk
- **Transition plans** must be created and reviewed at 30/60/90-day intervals — missed reviews
  create audit findings
- **Sub-population reporting** (race, gender, SPED, 504, ELL, homeless, foster care) is required
  for federal equity reporting — districts often discover gaps too late
- **Recidivism risk** must be proactively identified so interventions can be assigned — most
  districts only see patterns after a second or third incident

**The core risk:** Paper and email-based systems cannot enforce timelines, create defensible audit
trails, or surface compliance gaps before they become violations. When TEA or OCR audits, districts
need documentation — and they usually don't have it.

## THE SOLUTION — FEATURE SET (Use for Feature Slides)

### Feature 1 — Incident Management
- Staff create a discipline incident with offense code (mapped to TEA PEIMS codes), consequence
  type (warning, detention, ISS, OSS, DAEP, expulsion), and supporting details
- System enforces the **discipline matrix** — minimum/maximum consequences by offense and grade
  group, preventing inconsistent disciplinary decisions
- SPED and 504 flags automatically route compliance requirements — no coordinator is missed
- Full audit trail with timestamps and reported-by attribution
- Document attachments (PDF, images, Word documents)
- **Headline for slide:** "Every incident documented, every decision defended"

### Feature 2 — Six-Step Approval Chain
- When a DAEP consequence is assigned, the system automatically creates a sequential approval chain
- Steps: Campus Behavior Coordinator → Counselor → SPED Coordinator (if applicable) →
  504 Coordinator (if applicable) → Student Support Specialist → Director of Student Affairs
- Each step captures approval date, approver identity, and notes
- A student cannot be placed until the full chain is approved — the system enforces it
- **Headline for slide:** "No placement without a complete paper trail"

### Feature 3 — SPED Compliance Tracking
- Automatic detection of SPED-eligible students on DAEP/expulsion incidents
- Compliance checklist enforces manifestation determination review before placement
- ARD meeting scheduling tracked within the placement record
- Compliance holds block placement until all requirements are cleared
- SPED coordinator dashboard view — only their cases, clearly flagged
- **Headline for slide:** "Manifestation determinations documented before day one"

### Feature 4 — Orientation Kiosk + Reflection Form
- Students check in at the Orientation Kiosk on their scheduled orientation day
- Students complete a **Student Reflection** (what happened, what they'd do differently)
- Students build a **My Behavior Plan** — 3 behavioral goals with supports and interventions
- The form is saved digitally and can be printed with signature lines for the student's file
- Orientation check-in does NOT count as a DAEP attendance day — program integrity is maintained
- **Headline for slide:** "Students arrive with a plan, not just a placement"

### Feature 5 — Daily Student Kiosk
- Students enter their Student ID each morning — no login, no password
- Records the check-in and displays a **DAEP Placement Tracker** (visual progress bar with
  milestones at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of days served)
- Displays **My Daily Goals** — the student's 3 behavior plan goals as a daily reminder
- Phone bag/locker number recorded for device policy compliance
- One check-in per day enforced at both application and database level
- **Headline for slide:** "Students see their progress every single day"

### Feature 6 — DAEP Dashboard
- Summary cards: Active enrollments, pending placements, compliance holds, completed YTD
- Active Enrollments Table: Days served, days remaining, sub-population flags per student
- Approval Flow Table: In-progress approval chains with step-by-step indicators; filterable to
  "My Approvals" for each staff role
- Scheduled Orientations widget: Upcoming orientations in the next 7 days
- Sub-Population Charts: Race/ethnicity, gender, SPED/504/Gen Ed, grade level breakdowns;
  plus homeless and foster care counts
- **Headline for slide:** "Every administrator sees the full picture in one view"

### Feature 7 — Transition Plans
- Created per incident, typed as Behavioral Plan or DAEP Exit Plan
- Goals and success metrics in structured fields
- 30/60/90-day review dates tracked; overdue reviews flagged in red
- Linked interventions from the district's intervention library
- **Headline for slide:** "Structured support from day one through DAEP exit"

### Feature 8 — Recidivism Risk Engine
- Scores students 0–100 based on: incident frequency, recency, severity, SPED status, age of
  first offense, behavior types
- Classifies students as Low / Medium / High risk
- Surfaces contributing factors with point breakdowns
- Suggests tiered interventions based on risk profile
- **Headline for slide:** "Stop the next incident before it happens"

### Feature 9 — Compliance Reporting & Export
- Sub-population breakdowns for PEIMS-required categories
- SPED cumulative day tracking across all incidents in a school year
- Alerts for repeat offenders, ISS frequency, and cross-offense patterns
- Export to PDF and Excel across all major data tables
- **Headline for slide:** "Audit-ready reports in seconds, not days"

### Feature 10 — Parent Portal
- Parents log in to view their child's incident history, status, and transition plans
- Read-only access — no ability to modify records
- Keeps families informed without creating workflow disruptions
- **Headline for slide:** "Families stay informed without burdening staff"

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS (Use for "Why Waypoint" Slides)

1. **End-to-end** — incident creation to DAEP exit in one system; no jumping between tools
2. **SPED compliance is core** — manifestation determinations and ARD tracking built in, not
   bolted on
3. **Student-facing** — students own their check-in and see their own progress daily
4. **Behavior goals travel** — set at orientation, displayed at every check-in
5. **No placement without approval** — the system physically blocks it
6. **Real-time visibility** — administrators see the live picture, not a weekly email summary
7. **Texas-specific** — TEA PEIMS codes, TEC Chapter 37, SPED compliance timelines baked in
8. **FERPA-compliant by design** — row-level security, kiosk idle timeouts, no PII to anonymous
   sessions

## MARKET CONTEXT (Use for Market / Opportunity Slides)

- Texas has **1,200+ school districts**, the majority operating DAEPs
- Federal and state compliance requirements are **increasing** — IDEA, Section 504, ESSA,
  TEA accountability all touch DAEP operations
- Most districts today manage DAEP with a combination of spreadsheets, email, and paper forms
- There is **no dominant purpose-built DAEP management platform** in Texas — the market is open
- Recurring SaaS model with high switching costs once embedded in district operations
- Adjacent expansion opportunities: alternative schools, in-school suspension management,
  multi-campus disciplinary programs; and geographic expansion to other states with similar
  alternative placement requirements (CA, FL, GA, NC all have analogous programs)
