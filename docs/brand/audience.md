# Waypoint — Audience Personas

## Persona 1: The District Administrator

**Title:** Assistant Superintendent for Student Services / Director of Student Affairs
**Budget authority:** Yes — they approve or recommend the purchase
**Day-to-day Waypoint use:** Occasional — they review reports, monitor alerts, respond to escalations

**Pain points:**
- Stays up at night worrying about a SPED placement that wasn't documented correctly
- Receives audit findings that were preventable with better tracking
- Gets calls from parents who weren't notified on time
- Manually compiles PEIMS data every submission cycle
- Doesn't know which campuses have chronically missed compliance steps until it's too late

**What they care about in a demo:**
- "Can this protect us from a complaint or lawsuit?"
- "How long does it take to implement?"
- "What does it cost vs. what we spend on staff time now?"
- "Will the principals actually use it?"

**How to win them:** Lead with liability reduction and audit-readiness. Show the compliance blocking feature first. Then show reports they can bring to a board meeting.

## Persona 2: The Principal / Assistant Principal

**Title:** Campus Principal, Assistant Principal, Dean of Students
**Budget authority:** No — they influence, don't approve
**Day-to-day Waypoint use:** High — creating incidents, reviewing approval chain, managing placements

**Pain points:**
- Fills out the same paper form 3 times for one discipline event
- Doesn't always know where a referral is in the review process
- Gets surprised by a SPED requirement they didn't catch at the start
- Has to call the CBC or counselor to find out what's happening
- Misses the 30-day review because no one reminded them

**What they care about in a demo:**
- "How many clicks does it take to create an incident?"
- "Will I know when something is waiting on me?"
- "Can I do this from my phone when I'm in the hallway?"

**How to win them:** Show the incident creation wizard. Show the approval chain status view. Show how the system notifies them when action is needed. Speed and clarity are everything.

## Persona 3: The SPED Coordinator

**Title:** Special Education Coordinator, Special Education Director
**Budget authority:** No — strong influencer
**Day-to-day Waypoint use:** Moderate — reviews compliance checklists, participates in MDR tracking, monitors SPED alerts

**Pain points:**
- The most technically demanding audience — knows IDEA inside out
- Has seen districts get OCR complaints from missed steps
- Frustrated by principals who start the DAEP process before notifying SPED
- Manually tracks every SPED student's discipline events to catch patterns
- Dreads the phone call about a manifestation determination that wasn't done

**What they care about in a demo:**
- Does it correctly implement the 10-school-day MDR requirement?
- Does it block placement until all 9 checklist items are done?
- Can they see all SPED students with open compliance checklists across the district?
- Is the FAPE plan requirement documented?

**How to win them:** Go deep on the compliance checklist. Show every step. Don't oversimplify. They will ask hard questions and that is a good sign — they're evaluating whether to trust it. Precision wins this persona, not pitch.

## Persona 4: The Parent

**Title:** Parent or Guardian
**Budget authority:** None — end user of the parent portal only
**Day-to-day Waypoint use:** Occasional — checking on their child's incident status, reading placement documentation

**Pain points:**
- Doesn't understand what DAEP placement means or how long it lasts
- Feels excluded from the process
- Gets a letter in the mail days after the decision was made
- Doesn't know what a "transition plan" is or what their child needs to do

**What they care about:**
- Clear, plain-language explanations of what happened and why
- Visibility into how long the placement lasts and what the path back looks like
- Feeling like they're being informed, not just notified

**How to win them (and their district):** The parent portal is a district-facing selling point ("we give parents transparency"). The actual parent experience must be warm, clear, and non-jargon. If parents call the district complaining about the portal, the district blames Waypoint.
