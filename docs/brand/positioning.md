# Waypoint — Market Positioning

## One-Sentence Position

Waypoint is the only discipline management platform built specifically for Texas K-12 districts that blocks DAEP and expulsion placements for SPED/504 students until every required compliance step is complete.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Texas districts face a compliance minefield with every DAEP placement:

1. **SPED/504 compliance is manual and error-prone.** Manifestation determinations, ARD meetings, BIP reviews, FAPE plans — missing one step creates federal liability. Districts track this in spreadsheets or paper checklists.
2. **Transition plans exist on paper, not in workflow.** 30/60/90-day reviews are required but rarely tracked systematically. Missed reviews show up in audits.
3. **Repeat offender patterns are invisible until too late.** No system flags when a student hits their 2nd DAEP placement in a year or their 3rd ISS in 30 days.
4. **PEIMS reporting is painful.** Extracting correctly coded incident data for state submission is a manual, error-prone process.
5. **Parents are kept in the dark.** Communication about placements is inconsistent and undocumented.
6. **Laserfiche workflows don't talk to anything.** Districts using Laserfiche for DAEP approval get a morning Excel report and manually update their records.

## Who We're For

**Primary buyer:** District administrator or assistant superintendent responsible for student services / discipline compliance in a Texas K-12 district.

**Primary users:** Principals, assistant principals, campus behavior coordinators, SPED coordinators, counselors.

**Sweet spot:** Mid-size Texas districts (5–20 campuses) with a DAEP campus — big enough to have real compliance pressure, small enough that the administrator is still hands-on.

**Secondary market:** Large districts (20+ campuses) as enterprise deals, ESCs serving multiple smaller districts.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. SPED Compliance Blocking (Unique)
Waypoint physically blocks DAEP/expulsion placement for SPED/504 students until the compliance checklist is complete. Competitors send reminders. We block the action. This is the single most important differentiator for districts that have been cited or are worried about audit findings.

### 2. Transition Plans with Structured Reviews
Not just a text box — structured 30/60/90-day reviews that track specific metrics (office referrals, CICO scores, grades, attendance, behavioral scores) over time. Plans are linked to originating incidents for full traceability.

### 3. Repeat Offender Early Warning
Automatic red/yellow alerts for dangerous patterns that humans miss when managing hundreds of students. Four triggers: 2nd DAEP placement (same year), 3+ ISS in 30 days, same offense 3+ times, 5+ referrals in 30 days.

### 4. Laserfiche Integration
Districts already using Laserfiche for DAEP approval workflows can sync their daily morning report directly into Waypoint. No duplicate entry. Students and incidents are created automatically if missing.

### 5. Texas-Native
Not a generic national platform with TEC bolted on. Built from TEC Chapter 37, with PEIMS action codes, Texas SPED procedures, ARD committee workflows, and Laserfiche (the most common Texas district document management system) integration.

### 6. Modern, Fast, Mobile-Friendly
React SPA on Supabase — not a legacy ASP.NET or Java system from 2008. Works on tablets and phones. Staff can create an incident from a hallway confrontation without going back to their desk.

## Competitive Landscape

**What districts currently use:**
- Spreadsheets and Google Sheets (most common for small districts)
- Frontline (Incident IQ) — national platform, not Texas-specific, no compliance blocking
- PowerSchool behavior module — bolted-on, not built for DAEP workflow
- Paper forms + Laserfiche — the workflow Waypoint integrates with

**Our displacement story:** We don't replace their SIS (Skyward, PowerSchool, Infinite Campus). We sit on top of it as the discipline compliance layer that their SIS doesn't provide.

---

## What We're Not

- Not a student information system (SIS) — we complement Skyward/PowerSchool/IC
- Not a surveillance tool — we manage compliance paperwork and workflow, not student behavior monitoring
- Not a national platform trying to fit Texas — we are Texas-native from day one
