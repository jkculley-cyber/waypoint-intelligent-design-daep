# Waypoint — Brand Voice

## Core Tone

**Compliance-first, student-centered.** Waypoint speaks with the confidence of someone who has read TEC Chapter 37 and the authority of someone who actually understands what a manifestation determination is. At the same time, the product exists to help students — not to make discipline more efficient as an end in itself.

## Audience-Specific Tone

### District Administrators & Superintendents
- Speak their language: budget cycles, audit exposure, board reporting, staff time
- Lead with liability reduction and compliance automation
- Be direct about what the tool does — they don't have patience for vague value props
- Acknowledge the real tension: discipline must be fair, documented, and defensible

### Principals & Assistant Principals
- Emphasize speed and simplicity — they're making decisions under pressure
- Show how Waypoint removes the mental load of tracking compliance manually
- Acknowledge the hard reality: discipline decisions affect kids' lives and district liability

### SPED Coordinators
- This is your most technically demanding audience — they know IDEA, FAPE, ARD, BIP, FBA
- Don't oversimplify compliance. They'll respect precision and distrust vague assurances.
- Waypoint is built around their workflow — show that, don't just tell it
- Key message: "You shouldn't have to remember 14 checklist items under deadline pressure"

### Parents
- Warm, clear, non-judgmental
- Transparency framing: "You have the right to see what's happening with your child"
- Avoid bureaucratic language — explain what things mean, not just what they're called
- Never surveillance framing — this is about informed parents, not monitoring

## What We Say

| Instead of... | Say... |
|--------------|--------|

| Discipline software | Compliance platform / behavioral management |
| Tracking violations | Supporting students through the discipline process |

## What We Never Say

- "Zero tolerance" — politically and legally charged, not our positioning
- "Surveillance" — especially for parent portal or kiosk features
- "Automate discipline" — discipline decisions are human; Waypoint automates the paperwork
- Any TEC section number we haven't verified (see DECISIONS.md)

## Writing Style

- **Headings:** Title case for major sections, sentence case for sub-items
- **Lists:** Prefer bullets over paragraphs for feature descriptions
- **Length:** District admins skim. Lead with the key point. Details follow.
- **Data:** Specific numbers are more credible than vague claims ("30/60/90-day reviews" not "regular check-ins")
- **Acronyms:** Spell out on first use in any customer document, even if the audience knows it
