## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Intelligent Discipline System (IDS)
**Subtitle:** Compliance-Driven, Data-Informed, Equity-Focused
**Tagline:** Reducing Recidivism Through Smart Intervention

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem (3 bullet points)
**Title:** The Current Reality

- SPED students are 13% of population but 30-40% of DAEP placements
- Average SPED discipline lawsuit costs $50,000 - $500,000 in legal fees + settlements
- 30-50% of DAEP students return within the same school year

**Visual:** Split screen - left side shows the statistics, right side shows a dollar sign or gavel icon

---

## SLIDE 3: Why This Happens
**Title:** Root Causes

- Campuses don't always implement BIPs/504 plans properly before escalating to DAEP
- No standardized compliance workflow exists between the principal's office and SPED department
- Discipline decisions happen in isolation - no pattern recognition, no data-informed process
- Students return from DAEP to the same environment with no individualized transition plan

---

## SLIDE 4: Introducing IDS
**Title:** The Solution: Intelligent Discipline System

- A web-based platform that PREVENTS compliance violations, REDUCES recidivism, and PROTECTS districts legally
- Built specifically for Texas school districts and DAEP programs
- Aligned with TEA requirements, IDEA federal law, and PEIMS reporting

## SLIDE 5: Feature 1 - SPED Compliance Checkpoint
**Title:** Automatic SPED Compliance Protection

**How it works (with icons for each step):**
1. Principal initiates DAEP recommendation in IDS
2. System automatically checks: Is this student SPED? 504? ELL? Homeless? Foster care?
3. If SPED/504: System BLOCKS placement and generates a compliance checklist
4. Checklist includes: ARD notification, manifestation determination, BIP review, FBA, parent safeguards, FAPE plan
5. SPED coordinator is automatically notified via email
6. Placement cannot proceed until all items are completed and documented

**Key point:** Every step is logged for audit trail = legal protection

---

## SLIDE 6: Feature 1 - Visual Demo
**Title:** What Staff Sees

**Show screenshots or mockups of:**
- The red "DAEP Placement Blocked" banner
- The interactive compliance checklist with checkboxes and timestamps
- The manifestation determination result (is/is not a manifestation)
- The progress bar filling as items are completed

---

## SLIDE 7: Feature 2 - Repeat Offender Alert System
**Title:** Identifying Students Who Need More Support

**Automatic triggers:**
- RED FLAG: 2nd DAEP placement in the same school year
- RED FLAG: 3+ ISS placements in 30 days
- YELLOW FLAG: Same offense committed 3+ times
- YELLOW FLAG: 5+ office referrals in 30 days

**What happens:**
- Automatic email sent to campus team (principal, counselor, AP, SPED coordinator)
- Required action checklist: root cause analysis, previous plan review, SPED referral consideration
- System suggests evidence-based interventions based on the offense pattern

---

## SLIDE 8: Feature 3 - Offense-Based Discipline Matrix
**Title:** Standardized, Equitable Discipline

- Pre-loaded with Texas Education Code requirements
- District-customizable consequence ranges per offense
- When an offense is entered, system auto-suggests the appropriate consequence range
- Flags deviations from district policy
- Same offense = same consequence range across the entire district

**Key equity point:** Standardized matrix = consistent discipline = reduced disproportionality = fewer OCR complaints

---

## SLIDE 9: Feature 4 - Transition Planning Engine
**Title:** Reducing Recidivism with Individualized Plans

- Auto-generated, offense-specific transition plans for every DAEP exit
- Includes: behavioral supports (CICO, social skills), academic supports, parent engagement plan
- 30/60/90 day review schedule with measurable success metrics
- Escalation protocols if student struggles after return

**Visual:** Sample transition plan showing behavioral supports, success metrics, and review dates

---

## SLIDE 10: Feature 5 - Reporting & Analytics
**Title:** Data-Informed Decision Making

- Disproportionality monitoring: discipline by race, SPED status, gender, ELL
- Recidivism rate tracking: % of students who return to DAEP within 1 year
- Intervention effectiveness: which interventions actually work
- PEIMS-ready data export: generate TEA-compliant discipline reports in one click
- District-wide dashboards for superintendent/board presentations

## TALKING POINTS FOR Q&A

**Q: How is this different from our current SIS?**
A: Your SIS tracks what happened. IDS prevents what shouldn't happen. It adds compliance workflows, automatic alerts, and intervention tracking that no SIS provides.

**Q: Do we need to replace our current systems?**
A: No. IDS works alongside your SIS. In Phase 5, it integrates with your existing student information system.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Districts are typically live within 2-4 weeks including training.

**Q: What about data security?**
A: FERPA-compliant with role-based access control, encrypted data, and full audit logging. Every data access is tracked.

**Q: Can we customize the discipline matrix?**
A: Yes. The system comes pre-loaded with Texas Education Code requirements, but every consequence range, required support, and intervention can be customized to match your district's code of conduct.

**Q: What if a principal needs to override the SPED block?**
A: Admin-level overrides are available with a required documented reason. Every override is logged in the audit trail. This protects the principal by showing they acknowledged the compliance requirement.
