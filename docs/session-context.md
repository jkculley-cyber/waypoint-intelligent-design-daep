# Session Context — Waypoint
> Last updated: 2026-03-17 (Session AL — Apex: trial lead capture, notify-new-trial edge function, saveProfile returns ID, simplify fixes)

---

## Active State

- **Development phase:** Pre-pilot — product feature-complete, ready for first district pitch
- **Waypoint app URL:** `https://waypoint.clearpathedgroup.com` (also `app.clearpathedgroup.com`)
- **Company website:** `https://clearpathedgroup.com` (marketing site, static HTML in `clearpath-site/`)
- **Marketing site features:** Company-level site for Clear Path Education Group. Technology Suite (Waypoint live, Navigator + Meridian coming 2026) + Clear Path Suite bundle. **Interactive pricing calculator**. **Free Compliance Checklist** lead magnet. Google Slides embed + narrated video. SEO/sitemap/robots.txt. Cloudflare Web Analytics. Security page `/security.html`. Research page `/research.html`. **4 lead capture channels** all → Formspree `xpqjngpp`: demo form (`source=demo_request`), pilot application form at `#pilot` (`source=pilot_application`), floating widget (`source=chat_widget`), whitepaper email gate (`source=whitepaper_gate`). **Floating "Talk to Our Team" widget** with 7 personalised auto-replies by compliance challenge. **Dedicated pilot application form** at `#pilot` (district name, role, size, DAEP volume, urgency). **Nav has "Apply for Pilot Spot" button**. **clearpath-logo.svg** — SVG compass logo, transparent bg, sharp at all sizes. Page order: Hero → Stats bar → Compliance gap → Products → Intro to Waypoint → Differentiators → Simulation → Pilot Application → Who We Are → Pricing → Demo CTA → Footer. ⚠️ Site must remain company-level — not a Waypoint product page (see DECISIONS.md 2026-02-28).
- **whitepaper.html:** 20-point DAEP compliance self-audit checklist, 5 sections with TEC citation callout boxes, scorecard with scoring bands (18–20 compliant / 14–17 at risk / <14 urgent), print-optimized CSS, "Save as PDF" button. Lead magnet for district sales.
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages — `waypoint` project (app, deployed via GitHub Actions on push to `main`), `cpeg-site` project (marketing site, deployed via GitHub Actions `deploy-clearpath-site.yml` on push to `main` — **do NOT use `node deploy-clearpath.mjs` Direct Upload**, it creates broken deployments)
- **Supabase project:** `kvxecksvkimcgwhxxyhw` (single project, all tenants)
- **Migrations applied:** 001–058 (production). Migration 058: `incident_audit_log` table with RLS.
- **Demo seed data:** `supabase/seed_demo_video.mjs` — 12 active incidents, 6 transition plans, 57 days behavior tracking (Marcus/David/DeShawn), parent auth user `parent.marcus@gmail.com` / `Password123!` (Sandra Johnson, guardian of Marcus). `supabase/seed_navigator.mjs` — 13 referrals, 28 placements (6 completed + 2 active + 20 prior year), 6 supports, 3 campus goals seeded for Lone Star ISD (8 student risk scenarios: 3 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 2 LOW). 2 active placements (Marcus OSS, DeShawn ISS — no end_date) power the Active ISS/Active OSS tabs. `supabase/seed_meridian.mjs` — 9 SPED students, 4 IEPs, 2 504 plans, 3 ARD referrals, 1 CAP finding seeded for Lone Star ISD. Both Navigator and Meridian **enabled** for Lone Star ISD. Both seeders use Supabase REST API (no DB password needed).
- **Demo video script:** `docs/brand/demo-video-script.md` — full production package rewritten Session T. 10 HeyGen blocks (≤840 chars each), student-first framing, T.E.A./I.E.P./P.E.I.M.S. abbreviations with periods. B-roll shot guide (7 clips) at bottom of script.
- **Demo district:** Lone Star ISD (seeded), `admin@lonestar-isd.org` / `Password123!`
- **Waypoint admin:** `admin@waypoint.internal` / `Waypoint2025!` → `/waypoint-admin`
- **Email notifications:** Live via Resend — sandbox sender `onboarding@resend.dev` still active. Sender domain is `clearpathedgroup.com` (not waypointdaep.com). DKIM record (`resend._domainkey.clearpathedgroup.com`) already set in Cloudflare. SPF needs `include:spf.resend.com` added. Edge Function default updated to `noreply@clearpathedgroup.com`. Still needed: set `FROM_EMAIL` + `RESEND_API_KEY` Supabase secrets → redeploy `send-notification` Edge Function.
- **All demo accounts:** See `docs/demo-accounts.md`

## Product Suite

| Product | Status | Gate |
|---------|--------|------|
| Waypoint (DAEP) | Live | Default, all districts |
| Navigator (ISS/OSS) | Live — migrations 037–042 applied | `hasProduct('navigator')` |
| Meridian (SPED) | Operationally complete — read + write — migration 040 applied | `hasProduct('meridian')` |

## What's Working

- Full discipline lifecycle: incident creation → approval chain → DAEP placement → compliance checklist → transition plan → 30/60/90 reviews
- SPED/504 compliance blocking (triggers fire automatically)
- Repeat offender alerts (4 trigger types, red/yellow severity)
- Daily behavior kiosk + orientation kiosk (campus-scoped, SECURITY DEFINER RPCs)
- Kiosk PIN/DOB second-factor support (migration 033; activate with `?require_pin=1` URL param)
- Parent portal — read-only incident/plan access, DAEP days-remaining countdown, acknowledgment button
- Guardian management on StudentDetailPage — list, add, remove guardians per student
- Email notifications via Resend Edge Function — approval/denial triggers notify reporter
- Notification preferences per user (Settings → Notifications)
- User Management UI (Settings → Users) — invite, role-edit, activate/deactivate
- Reports with PDF + Excel export + PEIMS discipline data export (CSV)
- Recharts visualizations across all report tabs
- Calendar view (`/calendar`) — DAEP placements + review due dates
- Audit log table (migration 035) + `src/lib/audit.js` helper
- Data import wizard (campuses, students, staff, incidents)
- Laserfiche DAEP report import — daily Excel sync, upserts by Instance ID
- Waypoint internal admin panel (`/waypoint-admin`) — provision districts; Manage drawer; **Business Dashboard** (ARR/MRR/pipeline metrics, charts, contracts CRUD); **Product Hub** tab (product cards, 8 demo site links, demo credentials with copy/show-password toggle); **header URL pill** (live URL `https://waypoint.clearpathedgroup.com/waypoint-admin` with copy + open buttons); **Partner Chat** floating bubble (bottom-right, polls ops Supabase `xbpuqaqpcbixxodblaes` messages table every 5s, sender=Kim)
- Password reset flow (`/reset-password`)
- Error boundary — crash recovery screen
- **PWA** — `manifest.json` + service worker + Apple meta tags; installable on iOS/Android/Chrome desktop
- **Mobile responsive layout** — hamburger drawer (mobile), always-visible sidebar (desktop). `SidebarContext` at `src/contexts/SidebarContext.jsx`. No page files changed.
- Teacher referral page (`/referral`), DAEP scoring page (`/daep/scoring`)
- Bulk incident export (select checkboxes → Export PDF/Excel)
- **Navigator module** — referrals, placements, supports, student detail, reports, goals & progress, data import, **Escalation Engine**, **Skill Gap Map**, **Effectiveness**, **Disproportionality Radar**, **Pilot Summary** (gated by `hasProduct('navigator')`). Full audit done Session Y — all pages functional. Campus filter, risk score (0-100), Active ISS/OSS tabs, Goals Edit button, dashboard active supports card all fixed.
- **Meridian module (operationally complete)** — Dashboard, Timelines, Student Detail (Schedule ARD modal, Escalate modal, Link Waypoint modal, Generate Compliance PDF), Dyslexia/HB3928 (Mark Reviewed modal), CAP Tracker (task toggle, Log New Finding modal, Generate TEA Docs PDF), Folder Readiness, Waypoint Sync, Integration, **Transition SPPI-13** (compliance table + TransitionPlanModal 5 accordion elements + jsPDF report), **RDA Dashboard** (DL banner, 3 domain sections, indicator cards Live/Manual, RDADataModal 3-step, IndicatorEditModal). All hooks have `refetch()`. Mutations in `useMeridian.js`.
- **DAEP Analytics** — Analytics tab on DAEP Dashboard: CapacityTrackerWidget (occupied/reserved/remaining), EnrollmentByGradeTable (sub-pop breakdown). Reports → Enrollment tab. IncidentDetailPage capacity banner. `set_daep_capacity` RPC applied to DB (migration 048).
- **Origins module (live)** — 8 staff pages + full family portal: student 7-step scenario player (choose → outcome → reflect → commit → complete), parent view with conversation starters, 18 TEC-aligned global scenarios. Migration 044 applied — DB-backed sessions active.
- **Cloudflare Web Analytics** — auto-injected via Cloudflare Pages dashboard (no code token needed)

---

## Origins Family Portal
- Public portal at `/family` — no auth required
- Student view: `/family/student` → assigned scenarios → `/family/student/scenario/:id` (7-step player)
- Parent view: `/family/parent` → reads completed sessions from localStorage, shows conversation starters
- Scenario library: `src/lib/originsScenarios.js` (18 global scenarios, 8 TEC offense categories)
- Sessions stored in `localStorage` key `origins_sessions` until migration 044 is applied
- Staff pages at `/origins/*` gated by `hasProduct('origins')`

## Security Hardening (Done — Migrations 028–039, 045–046)

| Migration | What It Fixed |
|-----------|--------------|
| 028 | Revoked anon `SELECT` on `students` — kiosk uses RPCs only |
| 029 | Removed spoofable `p_user_id` from approval RPCs |
| 030 | Kiosk RLS overhaul — 3 SECURITY DEFINER RPCs |
| 031 | Storage scoped by `district_id` path prefix |
| 032 | Kiosk RPCs scoped by campus, validated DB-side |
| 033 | `students.kiosk_pin`, `incidents.parent_acknowledged_at`, updated `lookup_student_for_kiosk` RPC |
| 034 | `student_guardians` table with RLS |
| 035 | `audit_log` table with RLS |
| 036 | `notification_preferences` table with RLS |
| 037 | `navigator_referrals`, `navigator_placements`, `navigator_supports`; updated `provision_new_district` RPC |
| 038 | waypoint_admin RLS self-read policy on profiles |
| 039 | waypoint_admin RLS on districts/campuses/profiles; `set_district_tier` + `set_district_products` RPCs |

## GitHub Actions — CRITICAL NOTE
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` were blank in GitHub secrets since the Cloudflare migration (2026-02-21), causing blank app screens. Fixed by setting them via `gh secret set`. **Always verify both secrets are set after any repo migration.**

## Next Session Priority

**Apex Navigator polish** — TeacherDetailPage (observation history, growth arc chart, coaching focus editor), CommunicatePage (view sent emails, re-send, compose standalone note), SettingsPage (school info, account, email preferences).

## Pending / Not Done

1. ~~**Apply migration 044**~~ — ✅ Applied 2026-03-01 via SQL Editor. Run `node supabase/seed_origins_scenarios.mjs` to seed global scenarios if not yet done.
10. **Re-entry Intelligence System** — live (migrations 054-055, hooks, ReentryHub, dashboard widget, seed data for demo + sandbox).
1. **Set up `privacy@clearpathedgroup.com`** — referenced in all compliance docs; must exist before sharing docs with districts.
2. **Google Search Console** — register clearpathedgroup.com (Sage owns this).
3. ~~**Resend sender domain**~~ — ✅ Done (Session Z). clearpathedgroup.com confirmed correct. DKIM already set. Edge Function updated + redeployed. Secrets set.

## Apex — Summit Pathway (NEW PRODUCT, Session AA)

- **Live URL:** `https://clearpath-apex.pages.dev`
- **Repo:** `jkculley-cyber/clearpath-apex` (branch: master)
- **Supabase ref:** `jvjsotlyvrzhsbgcsdfw` (separate project — different auth pool from Waypoint)
- **DB password:** `ApexClearPath2025!`
- **Auth:** Magic link only, Resend SMTP configured
- **Migrations applied:** 001 (core schema), 002 (pg_cron morning brief scheduler)
- **Edge Functions deployed:** `transcribe-observation`, `generate-coaching-draft`, `send-observation-feedback`, `generate-morning-brief`
- **Secrets set:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`
- **Supabase PAT:** `sbp_34e3b7ef1d4e7b49995850e9e51d2550e8a78f05`

**Built this session:** Dashboard command center · Observation Loop (voice→Whisper→Claude→email) · Teachers Page (recency/growth arc) · Observation Review Page · Morning Brief (daily/weekly/monthly/long-range, pg_cron auto-delivers 5:50 AM CST)

**Built Session AJ:**
- Sent observation PDF fix — removed `setSent(true)` page-load bug, navigate to dashboard after send
- Morning brief root cause fix — `run_morning_briefs()` helper function (key embedded), cron calls that
- `reply_to` added to coaching emails — teachers can reply directly to principal
- 14-day trial — `trial_started_at` + `trial_path` columns on principals; migration 007 applied
- Trial banner in AppShell — last 4 days warning + expiry state with two paths
- Drip email sequence — `send-drip-email` edge function (day 3/7/14), `drip_emails_sent` dedup table
- Summer path automation — `handle-trial-extension` edge function (no JWT), records choice, schedules July 15 Resend email, notifies Kim, confirms principal
- clearpathedgroup.com updated — "Start Free 14-Day Trial" CTA, tagline copy
- `/try` route added to App.jsx
- Simplify fixes: removed `sent` state (derived from `obs.status`), parallelized Resend calls in both edge functions

**Built Session AL:**
- Trial lead capture — `notify-new-trial` edge function deployed: sets `trial_started_at`, notifies Kim instantly (name/school/district/city/trial dates), sends principal a welcome email from Kim with first-obs CTA
- `saveProfile()` now returns inserted ID via `.select('id').single()` — eliminates separate SELECT query
- `notify-new-trial` accepts only `principal_id`, fetches its own data from DB — removed 6-param sprawl
- DB update + emails run in parallel via `Promise.all`

**Built Session AK:**
- pg_cron verified: morning brief firing daily (last run 2026-03-17, 3 principals, succeeded). Duplicate cron (jobid 2) removed. Drip email cron (jobid 3 → 4) confirmed active, fires 6 AM CST daily.
- Sent walkthrough access: pushed ObservationReviewPage fix (removed `sent` state, navigate on send, no success screen). Previously-sent obs now load in read-only mode.
- Recent Observations panel added to dashboard — last 5 obs (all statuses) as clickable rows. Was fetched but never rendered.
- Trial banner suppressed for demo accounts — removed `created_at` fallback; only shows when `trial_started_at` explicitly set.
- Simplify: eliminated redundant 6th DB query on dashboard (derive `recentActivity` from `allObs.slice(0,5)`), extracted `OBS_TYPE_LABEL` const.

**Apex Pending:** TeacherDetailPage · CommunicatePage · SettingsPage · CSV roster import · Mobile optimization · Quick capture

## Key Rules (Compressed)

- React 19 + Vite 7 + Tailwind CSS 4 — no TypeScript
- Supabase for everything — no Express server
- PostgREST FK disambiguation: use `table!constraint_name` syntax for bidirectional relationships
- SPED compliance triggers: never bypass
- Laserfiche import: always upsert by `laserfiche_instance_id`, never duplicate
- `waypoint_admin` role: `district_id = NULL`, skips district fetch, tier defaults to `'enterprise'`
- TEC references: never fabricate section numbers
- Kiosk anon access: ALL data access through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs — all require `p_campus_id`, validated DB-side
- Storage paths: always `{district_id}/incidents/{incident_id}/...`
- PWA: service worker lives at `public/sw.js`, skips all `supabase.co` fetch requests
- `vite.config.js` includes `optimizeDeps.include: ['react-is']` — required for recharts to build
- Meridian tables: all prefixed `meridian_` to avoid collision with Waypoint tables
- Sidebar active state colors: Waypoint=orange, Navigator=blue, Meridian=purple
- Meridian mutations: async functions (not hooks) exported from `useMeridian.js`; all hooks now expose `refetch()`
- Escalate button (Student Detail): logs to console only until migration 049 applied — `alerts.student_id` FK points to `students` not `meridian_students`

---
